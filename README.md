## Description

This application is a PWA format application that will allow you to work with text, save it and update it. The advantage of this application is that using advanced technology, it allows you to work offline.

## Aims

- GIVEN a text editor web application
- WHEN I open my application in my editor
  THEN I should see a client server folder structure
- WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
  THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
- WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
  THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
- WHEN I run my webpack plugins
  THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
- WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
  THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
- WHEN I open the text editor
  THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
- WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
  THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
- WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
  THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
- WHEN I click on the Install button
  THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
- WHEN I load my web application
  THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
- WHEN I register a service worker
  THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
- WHEN I deploy to Heroku
  THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
